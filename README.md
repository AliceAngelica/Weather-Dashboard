# Weather-Dashboard

An interactive application that displays a 5-day weather forecast of any location.

## Description

The aim of this project was to create a functional application that would display a 5-day forecast which included the temperature, humidity and wind speed of any location entered into the search bar.

## Usage

A weather application was made using JavaScript, JQuery, Bootstrap, an API and HTML. The purpose of this application was to allow users to find a 5-day forecast of various locations of their choosing. The application lists the searched locations in a column that can be reselected in the future.

When locations are searched, the location will be saved onto the left side of the page so that the next time the user visits the application they can easily access previously searched locations.
